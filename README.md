# Linked List
This project creates a custom linked list structure.  
   It serves as an exercise in working with linked lists and nodes.
   
   Create a Java class called NameList (not generic) that stores names and implements the
   structure shown above.  

   Note that the names are kept in sorted order.  Letter nodes are always uppercase.
   Lowercase names will follow uppercase names in normal sorted order.

   You may *not* use Java's LinkedList class.  You should create your own nodes and
   link them together as shown in the illustration.
